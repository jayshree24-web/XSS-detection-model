# XSS-detection-model# XSS Detection using Machine Learning

## Summary

In this GitHub repository, we present an innovative approach for classifying web-based application inputs as either XSS attacks or benign inputs. Our primary goal is to build an optimal model that enhances prediction accuracy while reducing both time and effort in the detection process.

## Key Features and Strategies

### AdaBoost Algorithm
We have leveraged the AdaBoost algorithm as the core classification method. This boosting algorithm has proven to be effective in improving the performance of weak learners, making it a valuable tool in our XSS attack detection system.

### Enhanced Pre-processing
To better prepare our data for classification, we adopted count vectorization to extract features from XSS attack scripts. This method helps us represent text data in a numerical format, improving the effectiveness of our model.

### Substantial Data Collection
We understand that data quality plays a crucial role in model performance. To address this, we collected a substantial and diverse dataset. This dataset is instrumental in reducing data variance, leading to a more robust and reliable XSS attack detection system.

### Adaptability to New Attack Environments
Our approach is designed to adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of web-based attacks. By incorporating a recent feature set, our model can quickly learn and identify differences in the latest malicious payloads. This adaptability requires minimal effort, ensuring that our detection system stays effective over time.

### Recent Data
We have based our approach on a recent dataset, reflecting the latest trends and patterns in web-based attacks. This ensures that our model remains relevant and up-to-date in detecting XSS attacks.
